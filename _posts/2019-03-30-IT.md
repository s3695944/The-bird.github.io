Programming is one of my favourite part in IT because typing codes make me feel satiated. When I create a web page or a program, I feel happy and be proud of myself.

# When did I interest in IT start? 

My first time to touch IT things When I studied at my secondary School In China, I was addicted into it totally. Only some words and symbols to create a useful and convenient program for users. That's awesome!

Actually, My teacher who taught me about IT in my secondary School is the person that sparked my interest of IT. I am very grateful to my teacher.
